<h1>Title: Energy Efficient Interior Design Tips</h1>

# Designing for a Cooler home
- Install fans to keep cool and save on air conditioning. Using a fan instead of an air-conditioner can save you $385 a year!Ceiling fans are more effective than standing fans for cooling purposes and they come in a wide variety of colours, shapes and styles to match any home interior design. 
- Choose light colours such as cream, white or beige for walls and large furniture. These reflect heat better than dark colours.
- Use curtains or blinds over windows, or solar window films to block unwanted heat from the sun, especially for east- and west-facing windows.
- Avoid obstructing windows and pathways with large furniture pieces as they block airflow for natural ventilation.
- Use partitions to minimise the space to be air-conditioned. Less energy is required to cool a smaller and more targeted space.

# Designing for a Brighter home
- Choose light colours such as cream, white or beige for walls, curtains and large furniture. These colours brighten up the room.
- Use light-coloured, loose-weaved curtainson your windows to allow daylight into the room while preserving privacy. 
- Consider task lighting to reduce lighting use.Did You Know? Task lighting refers to lighting directed at a specific work area to support a visual activity (e.g. reading, working). 
- Place floor or table lamps at corners as the reflection off walls will give more light.
- Install light dimmers to improve ambience of your home and to save electricity.

# Placement of Appliances and Power Sockets
- Position your TV and computer screens to be perpendicular to your window. This reduces glare and minimises the need to increase screen brightness.
- Ensure that power sockets are easily accessible and visible, so that turning off appliances at the socket after use becomes more convenient.
- Allow sufficient space around the refrigerator to ensure adequate ventilation. For example, allow spaces of 2cm on both sides, 5cm at the back and 10cm above the refrigerator, or follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. Insufficient spacing will decrease the cooling efficiency of refrigerators, resulting in higher energy use.
- Place the refrigerator away from heat sources such as direct sunlight, cookers and the ovens.
